                                                        Bohol has a large number of hotels, resorts, and other
                                                        facilities for tourists. Most of these are concentrated in
                                                        Tagbilaran and Panglao island, and more scattered around the
                                                        island. To help you make your choice we have listed most hotels
                                                        here, with some short personal comments. <br><br>

                                                        We often get requests for the cheapest resorts or places to
                                                        stay. This is a question we cannot answer. More important, it
                                                        often makes little sense to go for the cheapest. I think it is
                                                        better to go for the best value for money, within your budget,
                                                        and considering your wishes. There are very expensive hotels
                                                        that are worth every centavo of their rate and cheap hotels that
                                                        offer great value for money, but you can also be unlucky and end
                                                        up in an overpriced place at any rate.<br><br>

                                                        The purpose of this site is to help you find a place that
                                                        matches your budget and expectations. As a general rule, if you
                                                        want to stay directly on the beach, you pay much more, and could
                                                        easily find a much more pleasant place a few hundred meters from
                                                        the beach. When you select one of the larger, secluded resorts,
                                                        you will pay considerably more than with most smaller resorts,
                                                        especially if alternative locations are nearby (such as on Alona
                                                        Beach).<br><br>

                                                        Please also take into account that in the more secluded places,
                                                        you have less choice of restaurants (often only the resorts' own

                                                            The biggest risk is probably attracting a severe sun-burn.
                                                            Always protect yourself when exposed to direct sunlight.
                                                            Either wear covering clothing, or use high-factor sunblock
                                                            on the beach. Be aware that near water, your exposure
                                                            doubles due to reflected sunlight, while at the same time,

                                                            you are developing a severe sunburn before it is too late.
                                                            When snorkeling it is wise to wear a short wet-suit.

                                                            lotion that includes DEET, and cover your arms and legs. It

                                                            Tropical storms reach the Philippines with some regularity.
                                                            The storm season is roughly from June to November, but that
                                                            doesn't mean it is constantly storming during that period,
                                                            nor that storms cannot occur on other times. Since Bohol is
                                                            surrounded by other islands, Bohol will not be hit with the
                                                            full force of storms arriving from the Pacific ocean.<br>

                                                            In October 2013, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit Bohol,
                                                            causing about 200 causalities, and significant damage.
                                                            However, no tourists were effected. Earthquakes are very
                                                            hard to predict, and when they occur, it is best to leave
                                                            buildings as fast as reasonably possible, and stay outside,
                                                            away from buildings and other things that can collapse.<br>

                                                            Again, since Bohol is surrounded by other islands, the
                                                            chance a large Tsunami will hit it is small. Still, in those
                                                            areas that have some risk of tsunamis (the south-eastern

                                                            inland streams and rivers, be aware of the danger of
                                                            flash-floods. A heavy tropical rain can turn a gentle stream

                                                            When the strength of a stream starts to increase, get

                                                        have a hard time to select the most important things to see in

                                                        and just see the highlights. Unfortunately the other side of

                                                        If you are coming from Cebu, the route via Tubigon is probably
                                                        the cheapest and shortest way to reach Bohol. If you arrive

                                                        Lapinig island are further east). This cape with its limestone
                                                        rocks, caves, and secluded white-sand beaches can be reached via
                                                        the main town of Anda by following the coastal road (getting
                                                        narrow from that point onward) towards the North. After a few
                                                        kilometers, you'll see an entrance on your right hand side, the
                                                        starting point of the Lamanoc Island Mystic Tour. Here you can
                                                        walk along a very long bamboo pier, that leads through a large
                                                        mangrove forest.<br><br>


                                                        Don't walk too fast here, and take some time to study the
                                                        fascinating roots of these trees, and try to spot some of the

                                                        At the end of this pier, you will reach a waiting shed on poles,
                                                        where you can wait for one of the small bankas that will bring
                                                        you to Lamanoc point. These are the same bankas that the local
                                                        fishermen have been using for centuries, and you will literally
                                                        sit just a few centimeters above the surface of the sea. After a
                                                        short trip, you will reach Lamanoc point.
                                                        Lamanoc point is not just a beautiful nature spot, where you can
                                                        see various types of plants and animals, including some
                                                        indigenous monkeys, but also has a long mystical history
                                                        attached to it. Since pre-colonial times, it has been a holy
                                                        spot, where local priests and medicine men, called baylan or
                                                        tambalan, made their offerings to nature spirits, or diwata, who
                                                        where believed to reside here, and where called upon to provide
                                                        a bountiful harvest or good catch. These practices continued
                                                        long after the Spanish had converted the islands to Catholism,
                                                        with people mixing their ancestral believes with the new
                                                        teachings. Several balite trees, with their numerous aerial
                                                        roots add to the mystic atmosphere.<br><br>

                                                        Some of the caves here served as a burial place, so inside you
                                                        can find the remains of several wooden lungon or boat coffins,
                                                        so called because they have been from a dug-out log, similar to
                                                        the way boats where made, and old earthenware jars.
                                                        Unfortunately these jars were broken by misguided treasure
                                                        hunters, believing them to contain gold--all they got was human
                                                        bones, and they desecrated a human grave and destroyed cultural
                                                        heritage while doing so.<br><br>

                                                        Inside a rock shelter, you can see some prehistoric graffiti.

                                                        People used hematite (red iron oxide) pigments, found in the
                                                        hills of barangay Katipunan, to paint on the walls with their
                                                        fingers. A folk story has it that this paint was the blood of
                                                        pirates killed by angels. Nature also has worked its art here.
                                                        Inside the caves you'll see some interesting formations of
                                                        stalactites and stalagmites, including an entire row of small
                                                        stalactites that give the impression of shark-teeth. Another
                                                        curiosity is a giant clam shell embedded in one of the rocks,
                                                        showing that these rocks have raised from the sea in the past.

                                                        This process of limestone rocks raising from the sea is still
                                                        ongoing, as has been dramatically shown during the October 15,
                                                        2013 earthquake on the opposite side of Bohol, when Punta Cruz
                                                        was lifted more than a meter, and as a result the coastline
                                                        receded some 50 to 100 meters. After such an event, the sea will
                                                        start eroding the relatively soft rocks, creating the typical
                                                        overhanging walls you can see here.<br>

                                                        Although Baclayon was the first seat of the Spanish Jesuit
                                                        missionaries, fear of Moro marauders soon forced them to move
                                                        their headquarters more inland, to Loboc. Only in 1717, Baclayon
                                                        became a parish, and construction of a new church commenced.
                                                        Some 200 native forced laborers constructed the church from
                                                        coral stones, which they took from the sea, cut into square
                                                        blocks, and piled on to each other. They used bamboo to move and
                                                        lift the stones in position, and used the white of a million
                                                        eggs as to cement them together. The current building was
                                                        completed in 1727. The church obtained a large bell in 1835. In
                                                        the Baclayon church is a dungeon, which was used to punish
                                                        natives who violated the rules of the Roman Catholic church.

                                                        Next to the church is the old convent, which also houses a small
                                                        museum with centuries-old religious relics, artifacts and other
                                                        antiquities, dating back to the 16th century. Included in the
                                                        collection are an ivory statue of the crucified Christ looking

                        Since Cebuano has no official status, it is not easy to find books that will help you
                        learn Cebuano. In local bookshops, you'll sometimes find small phrase-books, but they
                        are not very useful to learn the language. However, good resources are available. We've
                        prepared on overview of Cebuano Learning resources on this site.<b> <a
