                        abandoned in 1563, out of fear for raids by the Portuguese and their allies from Ternate. It
                        will be
                        seen below how this event helped the Spanish to get a foothold in the Philippines.

                        <span class="p-4"></span>The Arrival of the Spanish
                        In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan and his crew were the first Europeans to reach the Philippines
                        coming
                        from the East. When they arrived they weren't really welcome: Magellan himself was killed on
                        Mactan
                        Island near Cebu, by the hand of a local chieftain or "Datu", Lapu Lapu.

                        <span class="p-4"></span>ollowing Magellan's route, the Loaisa Expedition left La Carua in
                        Spain
                        on
                        24
                        July 1525. This
                        expedition also reached the Philippines, but on the first of June, 1526, a hurricane
                        separated
                        the
                        ships. One of the ships, the Santa Maria del Parral, stranded on on the shore of North-East
                        Mindanao. The survivors were captured and sold into slavery. One of the crew members,
                        Sebastian
                        de
                        Puerto (or de Puerta), came in the hands of the Boholano chief Sikatuna. This is the first
                        contact
                        on record between a Spaniard and a Boholano.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="p-4"></span> More than forty years after Magellan's demise, in 1564, Spain sent
                        out
                        four
                        expeditions to establish
                        colonies in the Far East, and to pick up a share of the lucrative spice trade under control
                        of
                        the
                        Portuguese. These expeditions failed, but in the next year, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi was more
                        successful. Sailing westwards from Mexico with four ships and almost four hundred men, he
                        reached
                        the Philippines in the beginning of 1565, and established a Spanish settlement.

                    <p>
                        <span class="p-4"></span>This wasn't an easy achievement. Just like Magellan before him,
                        Legazpi
                        met
                        with hostile native
                        warriors, who didn't like the idea of foreigners invading their islands. His attempt to land
                        on
                        the
                        island of Cebu was thwarted, and he decided to look for a friendlier place. He lifted his
                        anchor
                        and
                        headed south in the direction of Mindanao. A change of wind, however, forced his fleet back
                        to
                        north
                        in the direction of Bohol. With the help of a Mohammedan Malay pilot from a captured trading
                        ship
                        from Borneo, he learned that the Filipinos were involved in trade with the Moluccas, Borneo,
                        Java,
                        Malacca, and even far away places such as India and China.

                        <span class="p-4"></span>The Blood Compact of Legazpi and Sikatuna
                        Also at Bohol, Legazpi was given a hostile welcome. From his Malay pilot, he learned that
                        this
                        hostility was due to marauding expeditions of the Portuguese. Coming from the Moluccas, the
                        Portuguese raiders traversed the Visayan seas, and just a few years before, in 1563, had
                        plundered
                        Bohol and killed or enslaved about one thousand of its inhabitants. Of course, the
                        Boholano's
                        easily
                        mistook the Spaniards for Portuguese.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="p-4"></span>Again with the help of his pilot, Legazpi explained two chiefs of
                        Bohol,
                        Datu
                        Sikatuna of Bool and
                        Datu Sigala of Loboc that they were not Portuguese, and had come in peace, and not to
                        plunder or
                        kill. This convinced the Kings to end their hostility and enter pact of friendship. On 16
                        March
                        1565
                        (or 25 March, records are confused due to the Gregorian calendar reform in 1584), Legazpi
                        and
                        Sikatuna performed the now famous blood compact, probably not far from the modern town of
                        Loay.
                        This
                        event is still celebrated in Bohol every year in June with the Sandugo ("One Blood")
                        festival.
                        The
                        same ceremony was repeated three days later with Sigala.

                        <span class="p-4"></span>The Conquest of Cebu
                        After he assured himself of the aid of Sikatuna and Sigala, Legazpi decided to try to
                        establish
                        a
                        permanent Spanish settlement on Cebu. With the native kings as guides, he lifted his anchor
                        and
                        left
                        Bohol on Easter Sunday, and arrived at Cebu on 27 April 1565.

                    <p>
                        <span class="p-4"></span>On the shore of Cebu, the local king Tupas already expected them.
                        He
                        had
                        grouped his warriors in full
                        battle array, ready to resist Legazpi and his invaders. In an attempt to negotiate a
                        resolution
                        of
                        the
                        impasse, a priest, father Urdaneta, went ashore, but he wasn't able to convince Tupas.
                        Legazpi
                        then
                        initiated an attack. While the ship's artillery battered the coast, Spanish soldiers landed
                        and
                        attacked
                        the Cebuano warriors. With their superior weapons the Spanish won a victory, and forced the
                        troops
                        of
                        king Tupas to retreat to the hills.

                    <p>
                        <span class="p-4"></span>After his defeat, king Tupas was more inclined to enter into peace
                        negotiations. With the help of Cid
                        Hamal, a Mohammedan Malay who stayed in Cebu at that time, a peace treaty was drawn up on
                        the
                        fourth
                        of
                        June 1565. In this treaty, king Tupas recognized the Spanish king as sovereign and agreed to
                        pay
                        a
                        tribute, for which, in return, Legazpi promised to protect him against his enemies and to
                        allow
                        trade
                        between the Filipinos and Spaniards. Also, Legazpi was granted a strategic site on Cebu,
                        where
                        he
                        founded the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Philippines.

                        In the footsteps of the Spanish explorers came the missionaries. About thirty years after
                        the
                        Spanish
                        established themselves on Cebu, on 17 November 1596, two Jesuit priests, Father Juan de
                        Torres
                        and
                        Gabriel Sanchez, arrived in Baclayon, Bohol. It is said that the mother of the encomendero
                        of
                        Bohol,
                        Do�a Catalina de Bolaos invited them. They established their headquarters in Baclayon, and
                        quickly
                        started to further spread the Catholic faith on the island.

                    <p>
                        <span class="p-4"></span>Only a few years after the Jesuits' arrival, on 26 October 1600,
                        Baclayon
                        was
                        raided by some 300
                        Maguindanao Moros commanded by Datu Sali and Datu Sirongan. In response, the Jesuits moved
                        their
                        headquarters to the inland town of Loboc, at a save distance from the coast. Since then,
                        until
                        the
                        departure of the Jesuits from the Philippines in 1768, Loboc has been the residence of the
                        local
                        Jesuit
                        superior. Here they also founded the first parish on the island in 1602, followed in 1604 by
                        a
                        school,
                        the Seminario Colegio de Indios, a training school for the children of the local ruling

                        The new religion was not easily accepted by all. In the year 1621, Tamblot, a native priest
                        or
                        babaylan
                        called upon the people to return to the faith of their forefathers, and to liberate
                        themselves
                        from
                        the
                        Spanish oppression. Around two thousand Boholanos joined him, and started a revolt when most
                        of
                        the
                        Jesuit fathers were absent, celebrating the feat of the beautification of St. Xavier in
                        Cebu.

                        to Bohol to suppress it. on New Year's Day, 1622, an army of 50 Spaniards and over one
                        thousand
                        Filipinos started their campaign against the rebels. In the following battle, fought out in
                        a
                        torrential
                        rain at Malabago, Cortes, Bohol, the mayor was wounded and the Spanish had to retreat. Six
                        months
                        later,
                        in a second attempt, the rebels where victorious again, but then some Spanish priests from
                        Loboc
                        managed
                        to enter the camp of Tamblot and assassinate him. Then, Without their leader, the insurgents
                        where
                        easily defeated, and Spanish power was restored.

                        <span class="p-4"></span>After these events, the Spanish more firmly established their power
                        on
                        Bohol.
                        Using the labor of local
                        workers, a number of magnificent stone churches were built, including the Church of

                        The oppressive methods of the Jesuits once more led to a serious insurrection against Spain.

                        the
                        year
                        1744, Francisco Sendrijas alias Dagohoy started a revolt that was to last more than eighty
                        nine
                        years.
                        The cause of this was an incident, in which the brother of Dagohoy was killed. Father Gaspar
                        Morales,
                        the Jesuit curate of Inabanga ordered a this brother, who was a constable, to capture a man
                        who
                        had
                        left
                        the Christian religion. The constable pursued the fugitive, but then was killed by him in a
                        duel.
                        However, when his body was brought back to town, the Jesuit refused the constable a
                        Christian
                        burial.

                    <p>
                        <span class="p-4"></span>Infuriated at the priest, Francisco Dagohoy organised the people in
                        an
                        armed
                        rebellion. The uprising
                        started on 24 January 1744 with the killing of the Italian Jesuit curate of Jagna, Father
                        Guiseppe
                        Lamberti. Not long after that, Dagohoy also killed Father Morales, and the rebellion swept
                        over
                        the
                        entire island. In vain, the Bishop of Cebu, Miguel Lino de Espeleta, attempted to calm down
                        the
                        situation, and restore Spanish rule. Dagohoy defeated the troops of Spanish and Filipino
                        forces
                        sent
                        to
                        subdue him. He established a free government in the mountains, and with his followers, was
                        able
                        to
                        control much of the island. Even after Dagohoy's death, his rebellion continued, while the
                        Spanish
                        were
                        only able to maintain their power in some settlements along southern coast.

                        <span class="p-4"></span>In the span of 89 years, no less than twenty Spanish
                        governors-generals,
                        from
                        Gasper de la Torre
                        (1739-45) to Juan Antonio Martinez (1822-25), failed to suppress the uprising. In 1825,
                        general
                        Mariano
                        Ricafort (1825-30), became governor-general of the Philippines. He send alcade-mayor Jose
                        Lazaro
                        Cairo
                        to re-establish Spanish power in Bohol. With an army of 2,200 Spanish-Filipino men, he
                        invaded
                        Bohol
                        on
                        May 7, 1827. However, it took more than a year of fierce fighting, and another Spanish
                        expedition
                        under
                        Capitain Manuel Sanz, who landed on Bohol in April 1828, before the patriots were defeated.
                        He
                        captured
                        last remnants of Francisco Dagohoy's rebel forces from their hideout in the Cave of
                        Caylagon.
                        So,
                        finally, by August 31, 1829, the rebellion was ceased. Most of the followers of Dagohoy were
                        pardoned
                        and resettled in new villages in the lowlands. These villages have now become the towns of
                        Batuanan,
                        Cabulao, Catigbian, and Vilar.

                        <span class="p-4"></span>In the mean time, in 1768, the Jesuits had been expelled from the
                        country,
                        and
                        their missions taken over
                        by Augustinian Recollects headed by their former Provincial, Fray Pedro de Santa Barbara.
                        Under
                        their
                        leadership, by 1800, the towns of Tagbilaran, Dimiao, Guindulman, Panglao and Loon had been
                        founded.
