                    Said to be a
                    tradition
                    in the island, the sandugo is solemn pledge that marks the bond of friendship between two tribes. It
                    is binding and must be honored by both parties. In history, the most famous Sandugo was performed by
                    the chieftain of Bohol Datu Sikatuna and Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi on March 16, 1565.
                    This was considered the first friendship treaty between the Filipinos and Spaniards.</p>

                    smalltown, unassuming church of Loay is not an exception. The smallest church compared to the grand
                    Baclayon and Dauis, but this church looked the most preserved and surprising. </p>

                <p style="padding: 2%; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;"> <br>One of the majestic sites that both
                    Filipino travelers and foreigners look forward to visiting in Bohol is the Dagohoy Marker. This
                    pristine and appealing cave is such an enthralling natural wonder coupled with rich historical
                    significance that it continues to mesmerize visitors of all kinds.
                    The Francisco Dagohoy Cave is particularly popular in Bohol due to its rich historical value to the
                    people of the province. The cave is named after Filipino patriot, Francisco Dagohoy, who led the
                    longest revolt in Philippine History. His rebellion lasted 85 years from 1744 to 1829. Local
                    inhabitants claim that the cave served as the patriot’s hideout during the rebellion and fight
                    against the Spaniards back in the 18th Century. Dagohoy and his men were mostly Boholano natives,
                    used the cave as a hideout and as their headquarters for the length of their revolt. Suitably
                    enough, the cave has an underwater passage that leads to dry land, which became useful every time
                    Dagohoy and his rebels had to escape the raid of the cave by the Spaniards.</p>
